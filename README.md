# Mosq_intract_dashboard
mosquito interactive dashboard using python 

- Developed this dashboard as part of my work as a Research Assistant
- this can be hosted on a local server or you can use the cloud to deploy the Python code.
- after executing the code you need to open the terminal and move to the folder where the Python file is present.
- 
  <code>panel serve python_notebook_filename.ipynb</code>
- then open the localhost address generated by the terminal in a browser as shown below.
